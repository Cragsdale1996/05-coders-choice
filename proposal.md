## Proposed Project

I will make a piano-teaching webapp that provides on-screen pianos for both student and teacher. The pianos will be keyboard-controlled, will sound for both members of the room, and will have visual feedback so that both members can see what the other is doing. To build on this further, there will be a built-in UI chord and scale library that highlights relevant keys for said chords/scales, and there will be a live room chat.

## Outline Structure

> Describe how you'll organize your code. What is the process and
> supervision structure? If it uses a framework, how does it fit in. I
> just need to understand the direction you plan to take. Again, three
> or four sentences are probably enough.



> replace all the ">" lines with your content, then push this to
> github and issue a merge request.
